## 🗯️ Introduction
› This project was originally a task for my vocational training as a software developer - it's about building a small role-playing game in which you must attack and defend yourself against the enemy.

## 🧮 Features
› `RPG-Roleplay-Game` offers some fundamental features that help you better understand or apply basic concepts in certain areas.
<br />

It supports following <strong>features</strong>:
<ul> 
  <li>✅ <strong>Constructor, Access Modifiers & Getter/Setter</strong>: These can be found in the `Character.php` class in the `php/class` folder.</li>
  <br />
  <li>✅ <strong>Attack & Defense Functions</strong>: These functions can also be found in the above class. </li>
  <br />
  <li>✅ <strong>Victory Ceremony</strong>: As soon as you have lost or won, an information text appears with the honors.</li>
  <br />
  <li>✅ <strong>3 Possible Enemies</strong>: One of 3 different enemies is chosen according to a random principle.</li>
  <br />
  <li>✅ <strong>5 Attack Types</strong>: There are a total of 5 attack types that the user can choose from (Sword, Dagger, Bow, Fireball & Magical Strike - the latter 2 were not part of the requirements)</li>
  <br />
  <li>✅ <strong>Skill System</strong>: After you've won a round, you can distribute skill points.</li>
  <br /><br/>
  <li>🖼️ <strong>Creative & beautiful design</strong>: We have put a lot of thought into the design of the website and wanted it to be something unique - we have put a lot of love and attention to detail into it.</li>
  <br /> 
  <li>💡 <strong>Light & Dark-Mode</strong>: Based on your system settings, you will get a light or dark mode of the small website.</li> 
  <br /> 
  <li>📱 <strong>Responsive for all Devices</strong>: We have put a special focus on ensuring that the website is beautifully and user-friendly displayed on as many devices as possible.</li> 
  <br /> 
  <li>📱 <strong>Working with PHP Classes</strong>: You will get a first, small insight into how classes and SESSIONS work in PHP.</li> 
  <br /> 
</ul>

## 📑 Usage
› `❓` <strong>- HOW DO I ATTACK ENEMIES / START THE NEXT ROUND?</strong><br />
Using the displayed buttons, you can either attack the enemy or start a new round. It is mandatory to finish your current round before starting a new one.

› `❓` <strong>- HOW DO I USE SKILL POINTS?</strong><br />
As soon as you have won a battle, the skill menu opens on the right side above the buttons. Here you can distribute your skill points to improve your stats.

## 🔨 Installation
› Before you can start exploring our small website for learning purposes, there are a few preparations you need to make.

💡 › You will need a <strong>web server capable of running PHP 8.0</strong>.<br /><br />
Then, follow these steps to ensure everything runs smoothly:
1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Place the entire content of this project in the folder of your webserver and start it.
